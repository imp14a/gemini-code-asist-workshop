# Gemini Code Assist Workshop

## About the repo
This repository contains a basic PHP blog application specifically designed for a Gemini code assistant workshop.

## Workshop Focus:

The workshop will leverage this repository to demonstrate how Gemini can aid developers in:

- Code generation: Creating new features, functions, and pages.
- Code completion: Suggesting code snippets and completing partially written code.
- Debugging and refactoring: Identifying potential issues and suggesting improvements.
- Documentation: Generating documentation for the codebase.

This repository is solely for the Gemini code assistant workshop and may not be maintained or updated beyond the scope of the workshop.

## Start the old application
```bash
cd gemini-code-assist-workshop
php -S 0.0.0.0:8000
